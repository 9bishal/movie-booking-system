## Railway Deployment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Railway account (https://railway.app)
- Git repository with code pushed to GitHub
- GitHub account linked to Railway

### Step 1: Create Railway Project

```bash
# Go to https://railway.app
# Click "New Project" > "Deploy from GitHub"
# Select your "movie-booking-system" repository
# Select "main" branch
# Click "Deploy"

# Railway will start building and deploying automatically
```

### Step 2: Add PostgreSQL Database

```bash
# In Railway dashboard:
# 1. Click on your project
# 2. Click "+ Add Service"
# 3. Search for "PostgreSQL"
# 4. Click "PostgreSQL" to add
# 5. Railway creates DATABASE_URL automatically
# 6. App auto-redeploys with database connection
```

### Step 3: Add Redis Cache

```bash
# In Railway dashboard:
# 1. Click "+ Add Service" again
# 2. Search for "Redis"
# 3. Click "Redis" to add
# 4. Railway creates REDIS_URL automatically
# 5. App auto-redeploys with cache connection
```

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables

```bash
# In Railway dashboard:
# 1. Click on your project
# 2. Go to "Variables" tab
# 3. Click "Add Variable" for each:

# Django Core Settings
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=_6$604vp-8p%p8y$j%txfa@*bzc)v5na6p7h)u135w1hllmo@k
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Get your domain from Railway dashboard (looks like: moviebooking-xyz.up.railway.app)
ALLOWED_HOSTS=moviebooking-abc123.up.railway.app

# Email Settings (Gmail with App Password)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=MovieBooking <noreply@moviebooking.com>
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True

# Razorpay Payment Settings (get from https://dashboard.razorpay.com)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your-razorpay-key-id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your-razorpay-secret-key

# Security Settings
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS=31536000

# 4. After setting all variables, Railway auto-redeploys
```

### Step 5: Run Database Migrations

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Migrations must run INSIDE Railway (on the server)
# Not from your local machine (Railway CLI can't access the internal database)

# Option A: Using Railway Dashboard Terminal (RECOMMENDED)
# 1. Go to https://railway.app and open your project
# 2. Click on your "web" service (top tab)
# 3. Click "Deploy" or "Connect" button (opens web terminal)
# 4. In the terminal, run:

python manage.py migrate --settings=moviebooking.settings_production

# 5. Then create superuser:
python manage.py createsuperuser --settings=moviebooking.settings_production

# Follow prompts to create your admin account
# Remember the username and password!
```

### Step 6: Verify Your Live App

```bash
# 1. Get your app URL from Railway dashboard
# 2. Visit: https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
# 3. Verify:
#    ✓ Homepage loads
#    ✓ CSS and images load (static files)
#    ✓ Login page works
#    ✓ Admin panel works: /admin
#    ✓ Can register new user
#    ✓ Can browse movies
#    ✓ Can book tickets
#    ✓ Payment flow works

## Troubleshooting

### App won't start
```bash
# Check logs in Railway dashboard:
# 1. Go to Deployments
# 2. Click latest deployment
# 3. Click Logs tab
# 4. Look for error messages

# Common issues:
# - Missing environment variables
# - Database not initialized
# - Port not exposed
```

### Database connection fails
```bash
# In Railway terminal:
python manage.py dbshell --settings=moviebooking.settings_production

# Verify DATABASE_URL is set:
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

### Static files not loading
```bash
# Redeploy with static file collection:
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --settings=moviebooking.settings_production
git add .
git commit -m "Collect static files"
git push origin main
```

### Email not sending
```bash
# Check environment variables:
# In Railway dashboard, verify EMAIL_* variables are set

# Test manually in Railway terminal:
python manage.py shell --settings=moviebooking.settings_production
# Then:
# from django.core.mail import send_mail
# send_mail('Test', 'Test message', 'from@gmail.com', ['to@gmail.com'])
```

### Redis not connecting
```bash
# Verify REDIS_URL is set:

## Deploying Updates to Your Live App

### Simple 3-Step Update Process

```bash
# 1. Make changes, test locally, and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: Description of change"
git push origin main

# 2. Railway automatically detects changes and redeploys
#    - Check Railway dashboard > Deployments tab
#    - Wait for "✓ Deployment Complete"

# 3. If you changed database models, run migrations IN RAILWAY:
#    - Go to Railway dashboard > Click "web" service > Click "Connect"
#    - Run: python manage.py migrate --settings=moviebooking.settings_production

# Your update is now live!
```

### Examples

**Update Django views:**
```bash
vim bookings/views.py
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Improve booking checkout flow"
git push origin main
# Railway redeploys automatically - done!
```

**Add new database model:**
```bash
vim movies/models.py
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate  # Test locally
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: Add movie reviews model"
git push origin main

# Then in Railway dashboard:
# Click "web" service > "Connect"
# Run: python manage.py migrate --settings=moviebooking.settings_production
```

**Update static files (CSS, images):**
```bash
vim static/css/style.css
git add .
git commit -m "Design: Update homepage styling"
git push origin main
# Railway automatically collects static files - no extra step needed!
```

## 🔐 Admin Access Setup (IMPORTANT)

### After First Deployment - Create Admin User

Once Railway deployment is complete, you MUST create an admin user to access both Django Admin and Custom Admin panels.

### Method 1: Using Railway CLI (Recommended - Fastest)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Create admin user with secure credentials
railway run python manage.py create_admin --username admin --email admin@yourdomain.com --password YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD --reset
```

### Method 2: Using Railway Web Dashboard

1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Select your project: `movie-booking-system`
3. Click on your Django service
4. Click "Terminal" tab (wait for connection)
5. Run this command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py create_admin --username admin --email admin@yourdomain.com --password YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD --reset
   ```

### Method 3: Using the Automated Script

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x setup_railway_admin.sh

# Run the interactive setup script
./setup_railway_admin.sh
# Follow the prompts to create your admin user
```

### What This Command Does

The `create_admin` management command:
- ✅ Creates or resets admin user
- ✅ Sets `is_staff=True` (required for Django Admin)
- ✅ Sets `is_superuser=True` (full permissions)
- ✅ Sets `is_active=True` (can login)
- ✅ Creates UserProfile with `is_email_verified=True`
- ✅ Bypasses email verification for staff/superusers
- ✅ Shows credentials and access URLs

### Verify Admin Access

After creating the admin user, test access to both panels:

1. **Django Admin** (Built-in)
   - URL: `https://your-app.railway.app/admin/`
   - Features: Full Django admin with all models
   - Login with your admin credentials

2. **Custom Admin Dashboard** (Beautiful UI)
   - URL: `https://your-app.railway.app/custom-admin/`
   - Features: Analytics, charts, booking management
   - Login with the same admin credentials

### Admin Command Options

```bash
# Create admin with defaults (username: admin, password: admin123)
python manage.py create_admin

# Create admin with custom credentials
python manage.py create_admin --username myadmin --email admin@example.com --password securepass123

# Reset existing admin user (update password/email)
python manage.py create_admin --username admin --password newpassword --reset

# Get help
python manage.py create_admin --help
```

### Security Best Practices

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Change default credentials in production!

```bash
# Use strong passwords:
railway run python manage.py create_admin --username myadmin --email admin@yourdomain.com --password "MySecureP@ss2026!" --reset
```

**Recommended practices:**
- Use unique username (not "admin")
- Use strong password (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Use your domain email for better tracking
- Regularly audit staff/admin user list
- Remove unused admin accounts

### Troubleshooting Admin Access

**Issue: Can't login to Django Admin**
```bash
# Check user status
railway run python manage.py shell -c "from django.contrib.auth.models import User; u = User.objects.get(username='admin'); print(f'Staff: {u.is_staff}, Super: {u.is_superuser}, Active: {u.is_active}')"

# Reset the admin user
railway run python manage.py create_admin --reset
```

**Issue: "User already exists" error**
```bash
# Use the --reset flag to update existing user
railway run python manage.py create_admin --reset
```

**Issue: Email verification blocking access**
- Admin/staff users automatically bypass email verification
- The `@email_verified_required` decorator checks `user.is_staff`
- Management command sets `is_email_verified=True` for admin profiles

### Verify All Admin Users

```bash
# List all staff users
railway run python manage.py shell -c "from django.contrib.auth.models import User; [print(f'{u.username} - {u.email} - Staff: {u.is_staff}') for u in User.objects.filter(is_staff=True)]"

# Verify admin emails for all staff
railway run python manage.py verify_admin_emails
```
